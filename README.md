Mirror issues to the upstream repos
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/apps/issue-up"><b>Install</b></a>
</p>

<br>

## Setup

- Install the [IssueUp App](https://github.com/apps/issue-up) for your repos / orgs
- Add `.github/issue-up.yml` to the repo you want to enable IssueUp

```yaml
upstream:
  dep-a: antfu/dep-a
  dep-b: antfu/dep-b
```

In the `upstream` field, the key represents the name of tag to trigger the action and the value represents the name of the upstream repo (currently only supports repos on GitHub).

> ðŸ’¡ To avoid spamming the upstream repos, we recommend to setup IssueUp **only when you controls both repos**. And it's recommended to not include that trigger labels in issue templates but only assign them manually.

## Usage

With the previous config for example, when you label an issue with `upstream` and `dep-a`:

A mirrored issue will be created in the `antfu/dep-a` repository:

With that, the two issues are linked together. Closing one of them will close the other one.
